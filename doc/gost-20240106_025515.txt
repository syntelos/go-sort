[RFC] Syntactic Dissonance

  Hi,

  Here's a case of "type dissonance" I don't understand.  Why should it be?

    https://github.com/syntelos/go-sort

  An interface type not passing through a static public package function that employs the interface.

    type Comparable interface {

      Compare(Comparable) int
    }

    func Sort(array []Comparable) ([]Comparable)

  With go-1.20.12:

    $ go test
    # github.com/syntelos/go-sort [github.com/syntelos/go-sort.test]
    ./sort_test.go:61:7: cannot use vector (variable of type TestList) as []Comparable value in argument to Sort
    FAIL    github.com/syntelos/go-sort [build failed]

  Any comments?

  Best,

  John
